After my very first CTF back in 2023, I was really interested in password cracking. It just makes you feel so powerful when hashcat comes back "Cracked". With me being so new to password cracking and cybersecurity in general, I decided it would be worth writing a program that could help me crack more passwords. It would serve as a little project to learn shell scripting as well as some more python.

Introducing **1337ness**, my password list generator. It gives a pretty little TUI (Terminal User Interface) that allows you to use leetspeak on words and lists, scrapes websites with CeWL and allows for wordlist appends/permutations.

The project can be found on [my GitHub](https://github.com/BrohdeXC/1337ness)
