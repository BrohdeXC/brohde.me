I'm Bradin Rohde, a mechanical engineering student and cybersecurity club president at Utah State University. My goal is to combine my knowledge of engineering and security to help make more stable security systems. 

Most of my time right now is dedicated to finishing up my degree, working on [ShellFire](projects/shellfire) for the class that I TA for, and designing 3D models in SolidWorks for Shasta Cloud.

When I'm not at work or school, I love to compete in CTFs. Using my knowledge of network analysis, OSINT, cryptography, password cracking, and whatever tools I learn along the way, I'm always fueled by Red Bull to place as high as I can.

**"Bradin, how did you end up doing cybersecurity while working on a degree in mechanical engineering?"**

In spring 2023, I was in a pretty low spot of the engineering program. Classes were rough, I wasn't enjoying a lot of it, and I wanted an escape. I came across NetworkChuck, David Bombal, and TheCyberMentor on YouTube and started binging their content. One day, I was walking to class and saw a table set up for HackUSU, a yearly hack-a-thon that my university puts on. I talked to the guy at the table, he got me on the cybersecurity club discord, and I went that next Wednesday. In my first day, I felt right at home, fell in love with the club, and 2 years later became the club president.
