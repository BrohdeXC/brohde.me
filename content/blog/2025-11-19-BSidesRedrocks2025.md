I had the amazing opportunity to drive down and give my first conference talk at [BSides](https://www.bsidesslc.org/) Redrocks in St. George, UT. Coming in from mechanical engineering, I show my problem solving process that I use in class and use it to build a framework that can apply to solving various cybersecurity problems.

# Overview
I presented 2 entirely different problems, one engineering, the other cybersecurity. The engineering problem came out of my Solid Mechanics textbook, and the cybersecurity problem was inspired by a recent CTF challenge that I had done the week before. Comparing the 2 problems, I walk through breaking them both down into solvable pieces.

Once the video is posted, I'll put that here!

## The Framework
1. Write down your **givens and finds**
2. **Visualize and understand** the problem
3. **Understand your tools** and when to use them
4. **Solve** the problem
5. **Repeat and Reiterate** 
6. **Verify** results
7. **Document** everything

## Givens / Finds / Research
* What information does the problem give us?
	* Write it all down
* What are we *actually* looking for?
	* It's easy to go down rabbit holes
* What things do we need to know?
	* What tools should we expect to use?

## Visualize the Problem 
* Understand what applies
	* You want to be able to remove the useless information
* Know how the given information affects the problems
  * Make assumptions as needed
* Roadmap / gameplan to get from A to B

## Understand the Equations (Tools)
* Many equations with the same variables
* Need to know which tools to use when you need them
* Toolbox - You won't need every tool all the time
* Experience - The more the better

## Solve
* Plug and Chug
* It's okay to guess for unknowns
	* As long as you have reasoning and can come back to verify later

## Repeat and Reiterate
* Oftentimes you'll have multiple steps to a problem
	* If you can script it, please do
* New information can reveal new methods
* Unknowns that we guessed can be converged on

## Verify Results
* Check against another tool
* Check with a peer
	* Solve separately, then come together
* This step often leads to step 6.5 - Troubleshooting

## Troubleshooting
* Check the math (inputs)
	* Break it down
	* Do it part by part if possible
	* Skipped steps can cost you time in the long run
* Check the method (Tools)
	* Some tools just suck
* Fail fast and fail hard

## Documentation
* Should be easy if you've been taking notes during steps 1-6
* Something visual to represent what was done
	* The easier to follow, the better
* Keep in mind your audience

# Final Thoughts
I had such a good time down in St. George for this conference, and I'm super grateful for the opportunity I had to give this talk. Shoutout to the event organizers for everything that they did for this event! I look forward to having everyone back up on my turf for BSides Cache!
